;You lower down on one knee, drawing a circle on the ground around you while
;intoning the spell words taught to you by your elders with a leaden tone of
;voice. As the last syllable leaves your cold lips, the dark cloud around you
;flashes with deep blue light, lowering the temperature of your body and the
;air around you towards freezing readings.

;Your concentration breaks due to your movement.
